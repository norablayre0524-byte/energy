# Analyzing Progress of SDGs
In 2012, the UN met and created a set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and subtargets to address the global effects of climate change. The timing of this meeting was significant as the UN planned to address an unprecedented time in energy transition that was rapidly evolving and still is today. As the UN attempts to guide countries to create a sustainable world that promotes social, economical, and environmental equality, it's important to analyze progress. Frequent changes in national leadership and overall global affairs can make this progression more challenging to achieve, so this dataset? Incorporates information from other data sources to examine the current position in SDGs compared to beginning points and target points.
